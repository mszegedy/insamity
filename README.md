# Sam: Embrace the Insamity

This is Sam. Sam loves you and is very sorry it isn't a better slugcat. It's
trying its best.

Sam is based in spirit on
[Programmercat](https://github.com/henpemaz/PartModPartMeme/tree/master/ProgrammerCat)
by [Henpemaz.](https://github.com/henpemaz) It doesn't reuse any code, and
technically doesn't directly reuse any mechanics either. What they have in
common is that they're both very brave little slugcats who suffer from a variety
of disabilities and disorders, and would rather stay home working on tech stuff,
but they go out and explore anyway. But while Programmercat was a software
developer, Sam is a hardware technician who specializes in data recovery. The
only advantage to playing as Sam is that it can recover bleached pearls by
swallowing them. They get unbleached in its stomach, you see.

Like Programmercat, Sam isn't meant to be taken seriously. Playing as Sam is
meant to make you suffer, although hopefully Sam is cute and friendly enough to
offset any additional suffering caused by its mechanics.
