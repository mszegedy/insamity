# Sam: Embrace the Insamity

This is Sam. Sam loves you and is very sorry it isn't a better slugcat. It's
trying its best.

Sam is based in spirit on
[Programmercat](https://github.com/henpemaz/PartModPartMeme/tree/master/ProgrammerCat)
by [Henpemaz,](https://github.com/henpemaz) although they don't share any code
or assets. What Sam and Programmercat have in common is that they're both very
brave little slugcats who suffer from a variety of disabilities and disorders,
and would rather stay home working on tech stuff, but they go out and explore
anyway. But while Programmercat was a software developer, Sam is a hardware
technician who specializes in data recovery. The only advantage to playing as
Sam is that it can recover bleached pearls by swallowing them. They get
unbleached in its stomach, you see.

Like Programmercat, Sam isn't meant to be taken seriously. Playing as Sam is
meant to make you suffer, although hopefully Sam is cute and friendly enough to
offset any additional suffering caused by its mechanics.

Practically every aspect of Rain World is heavily nerfed in some way as Sam, who
was never really meant to be released into the wilds, and has a very hard time
doing anything. But a core design goal for Sam was to make sure all modded
regions are accessible and playable as them, while still being a much more
difficult experience than Programmercat.

Sam's adventure takes place shortly after Rivulet in the MSC/Downpour timeline,
or shortly after Monk in the vanilla timeline. Once Sam itself is finished, I
plan to make a region for them, a future version of Metropolis from Artificer's
campaign. Until someone forces me to do otherwise, this region should be
accessible regardless of whether you have the DLC installed, and all of Sam's
features should be active, including their citizen drone. But that's a ways off
from now; right now I want to focus on Sam's core mechanics.

## Sam's core mechanics

Sam has trouble with everything. Here are some things it has trouble with:

- **Communication:** Sam doesn't understand it properly when iterators talk.
  They start with the Mark of Communication, but it's glitched, and everything
  iterators say will be translated very poorly. Sam's campaign revolves around
  fixing its Mark.
- **Eating:** Sam is only hungry for a couple foods at a time. They can't eat
  foods they aren't hungry for, except for plants, although they're not very
  filling if Sam isn't hungry for them. Like with Gourmand, you'll see what Sam
  is hungry for in the bottom left, above your food bar. Sam is hungry for a
  different amount of food each day, and always has to go to bed on a full
  stomach. They can't eat neurons, but they have other ways of getting food in
  iterators.
  
  Often, Sam will eat the same food for days, and then suddenly get tired of it,
  and have a couple days of chaotic food preferences until they find a new safe
  food. Whatever foods Sam gets hungry for, they'll always be foods that are
  found in the region you are exploring.
- **Fidgeting:** Sam is restless. If they're not rubbing themselves against a
  pipe or wall, after a couple minutes, they start fidgeting, switching up which
  hand is holding which of their items. After a couple more minutes, if Sam
  still hasn't rubbed itself against anything, it'll start pacing back and forth
  a little, and making small jumps.
- **Karma:** Sam doesn't move past psychological obstacles as quickly as other
  slugcats. Its karma increments and decrements in halves, and Sam starts with a
  max karma of ½. It doesn't gain any max karma from echoes, but they do max out
  its karma. Instead, Sam gains max karma by swallowing bleached lore pearls to
  unbleach them. But, only one at a time, which isn't much.
- **Glowing:** Sam starts with The Glow, but it's kind of broken. It's pretty
  dim, and sometimes it goes out for minutes at a time. Some days, its Glow
  suddenly works fine! But this is uncommon.

Sam also has trouble with the following things. Each day, Sam won't have trouble
with exactly one of them. Which one that will be is random, but it's never the
same one two days in a row. When you wake up, you are told which one Sam doesn't
have trouble with today, and an icon will appear for it above your karma symbol.

- **Athletics:** Like Programmercat, as well as Gourmand, Sam gets tired if it
  does too much jumping, climbing, and throwing. The only things that don't
  cause Sam even a little exhaustion are running and shimmying on poles. When
  Sam becomes exhausted, they become slow, and take longer to charge spear
  throws (if applicable).
- **Throwing spears:** To use spears, Sam normally needs to charge their throws,
  by holding the throw button. Otherwise, the spear will just whirl around and
  land on the ground. Charged spear throws do as much damage as a throw from
  Survivor, and can embed into most walls.
- **Holding its breath:** Sam is actually fairly good at holding its breath. On
  days when it's having trouble, it can hold its breath for about half as long
  as Survivor. On days when it's not having trouble, it can hold its breath for
  1½ times as long as Survivor, which is a lot.
- **Diplomacy:** Sam doesn't make friends easily. When Sam improves relations
  with anyone, they have to expend twice as much effort as Survivor. But they'll
  eventually get there!
- **Storage:** Sam normally can't store anything in its stomach other than
  pearls and neurons (which, lest we forget, are inedible to it).

As you can see, it is very hard being Sam! But Sam has a very big heart to make
up for it, and hopes you will consider guiding it on its journey.

  that Sam's sprite sheet is from.
- And of course, [Henpemaz,](https://github.com/henpemaz) for the inspiration
  and encouragement, as well as occasionally lighting a fire under my ass to
  make sure this mod actually gets made.
